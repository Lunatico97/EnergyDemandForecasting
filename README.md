# EnergyDemandForecasting
- Multivariate demand forecasting using Python-associated Toolkit
- Make sure you directly check the 'EnergyForecasting-Final.ipynb' notebook as other notebooks are mostly 'trial-test-tune' notebooks with lots of verbose output where you     have to scroll nonstop to see something relevant !
- Context: In an extremely fluctuating energy market where every distributor is trying to capitalize on day ahead market, we need to make sure we can make absolute profits by assessing accurate demand so that no production / supply gets wasted and prices can be dictated !

- All we got are the past records and all we know about is whether it is going to be a pleasant sunny day outside or pouring rain ?
- Let's forecast the demand for an entire week !
- Everything to do with data analysis, feature engineering and model selection with metrics are in the notebook, check it out !
- For now, check our best forecast results !
